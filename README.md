# MatrixFactorizer
Factors a square matrix A = LDU

## Usage
this project has three files: 
1) `get_l_u.m` factorizes A into LU. This program handles several error cases.
2) `get_l_d_u.m` factorizes A into LDU. Also handles necessary error cases.
3) `test_factorize.m` helper to test if the code is working.
4) `tester/m` tests if the code is working with 10 matrices.

Use these like normal matlab or octave files? We are not super familliar with how people generally use matlab or octave.

## Contributions
