# MatrixFactorizer
Factors a square matrix A = LDU

## Usage
this project has two files: 
1) `get_l_u.m` factorizes A into LU. This program handles several error cases.
2) `get_l_d_u.m` factorizes A into LDU. Also handles necessary error cases.

Use these like normal matlab or octave files? We are not super familliar with how people generally use matlab or octave.

## Contributions
